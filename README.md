Aditya Srivastava - Lab 3: React Notes COSC 052 Full Stack Web Development


### Description
For this lab, I implemented a real-time note editor with a Firebase back-end. This web app allows anyone with the site url to create notes and see other's notes, as they are all public. The functionality available with each note is: it is draggable, can be deleted, and you can edit the title and body text after it's been created.

### What Worked/Didn't
What Worked: I read the whole lab description before starting and implemented the structure of my code to be very similar to what I would need when I got to the Firebase part, so that I wouldn't be spendign most of my time refactoring code and changing my logic around. I believe this saved me countless hours of debugging and office-hour sessions!

What Didn't Work: I had a lot of trouble initially writing the code because I had to understand all the React/JS/JSX syntax, and all my problems that I went to office-hours for were related to syntax issues and not logic. I believe after completing this lab, I have a more solid understanding of React and the syntax surrounding it.
