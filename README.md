# Post It Notes

[Link to Published Post-It Notes Site](http://aditya-cs52-lab3.surge.sh)

### Description
I implemented a real-time note editor with a Firebase back-end. This web app allows anyone with the site url to create notes and see other's notes, as they are all public. The functionality available with each note is: it is draggable, can be deleted, and you can edit the title and body text after it's been created.

### How to Run
1. Go to post it notes directory in terminal
2. Enter: `yarn install`
3. Then: `yarn start`
4. Go to the local host on any browser of your choosing
